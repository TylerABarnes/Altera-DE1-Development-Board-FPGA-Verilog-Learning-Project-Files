# Altera-DE1-Development-Board-FPGA-Verilog-Learning-Project-Files
A collection of all my major Verilog experiments and learning code demonstrations for the Altera DE1 Development Board.

Each project provides the Quartus II project file, Quartus II output file, Verilog files to be included in the project, and the pin assignments needed to run the code properly on the board.

Included Is;

-"ClockDivider" : A simple clock divider where the user can alter the ratio interacting with the onboard 50 MHz clock to get any desired output frequency needed --> Good example of clock manipulation.

-"FOURBITALU" : A simulated 4-bit ALU where the inputs are taken from the switches on the board and the outputs are shown on the 7-segment displays --> Good intro to LUTs.

-"PrimeNumber" : A simple program used to test I/O on the board, a greem light indiciates if an entered value is prime or not --> Easy intro to port declarations.
